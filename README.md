# What the code does
This code helps to retrieve the data that is saved on git lab via Pavlovia.
The experiment that the data is taken from can be found here: https://gitlab.pavlovia.org/Anninas/human_ibl_piloting. For more information about the experiment you can look at it's README file https://gitlab.pavlovia.org/Anninas/human_ibl_piloting/blob/master/readme.md 
The code plots three plots for each of the participant that took the experiment and saves it in the behavioral_snapshot_figures folder
The first plot shows the signed contrast on the x-axis and the percentage of right choices ("m") for that specific contrast on the y-axis.
The second plot shows the signed contrast on the x-axis and the corresponding reaction time in seconds on the y axis 
The third plot show the trail number on the x-axis and the corresponding RT in seconds on the y-axis
