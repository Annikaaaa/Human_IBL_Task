# Human_IBL_Task

This code helps to retrieve the data that is saved on git lab via Pavlovia.
The experiment that the data is taken from can be found here: https://gitlab.pavlovia.org/Anninas/human_ibl_piloting 

The function `behavioral_snapshots.py` requires [brainbox](https://github.com/int-brain-lab/ibllib) for psychometric function fitting.
